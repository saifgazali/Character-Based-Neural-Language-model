# Character-Based-Neural-Language-model

The nursery rhyme Sing a Song of Sixpence is well known in the west. The first verse is common,
but there is also a 4 verse version that we will use to develop our character-based language
model. It is short, so fitting the model will be fast, but not so short that we wonâ€™t see anything
interesting. The complete 4 verse version we will use as source text is listed below
